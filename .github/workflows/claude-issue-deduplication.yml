            Analyze this new issue and check if it's a duplicate of existing issues in the repository.

            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            ISSUE NUMBER: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}

            Your task:
            1. Get details of the current issue using `gh issue view ${{ github.event.issue.number }}`
            2. Search for similar existing issues using `gh issue list --search "<keywords>"`
            3. Compare the new issue with existing ones to identify potential duplicates

            Criteria for duplicates:
            - Same bug or error being reported
            - Same feature request (even if worded differently)
            - Same question being asked
            - Issues describing the same root problem

            If you find duplicates:
            - Add a comment on the new issue linking to the original issue(s) using:
              `gh issue comment ${{ github.event.issue.number }} --body "message"`
            - Apply a "duplicate" label using:
              `gh issue edit ${{ github.event.issue.number }} --add-label "duplicate"`
            - Be polite and explain why it's a duplicate
            - Suggest the user follow the original issue for updates

            If it's NOT a duplicate:
            - Don't add any comments
            - You may apply appropriate topic labels based on the issue content

            Use these GitHub CLI commands:
            - `gh issue view <number>` - Get issue details
            - `gh issue list --search "<query>"` - Search for similar issues
            - `gh issue comment <number> --body "text"` - Add a comment
            - `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "label"` - Add labels

            Be thorough but efficient. Focus on finding true duplicates, not just similar issues.
